# Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the performance of various marketing campaigns conducted by a company in Malaysia. The goal is to identify insights that can guide future campaign strategies by analyzing key metrics such as ROI, budget efficiency, customer engagement, and channel effectiveness. Using real-world data, we applied data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization techniques to answer critical questions about campaign effectiveness across different regions, channels, and customer segments.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are:

1. **Understand Channel Effectiveness**: Determine which marketing channels generate the highest ROI and offer the most consistent returns.
2. **Evaluate Regional Performance**: Identify regions that yield the most profitable or receptive responses to campaigns.
3. **Analyze Budget Allocation**: Examine the relationship between budget allocation and campaign performance to ensure resources are optimally distributed.
4. **Provide Actionable Recommendations**: Based on the insights, suggest targeted strategies to improve campaign effectiveness across various channels, regions, and customer segments.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this analysis contains detailed information on different marketing campaigns, including:

- **Campaign_ID**: Unique identifier for each campaign.
- **Channel**: Marketing channel (e.g., Social Media, Email, TV, News, Radio, Billboard).
- **Product_Category**: Category of the product being marketed (e.g., Electronics, Fashion, Groceries).
- **Region**: Geographic area in Malaysia targeted by the campaign (e.g., Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Malacca).
- **Budget**: Budget allocated for each campaign in Malaysian Ringgit (RM).
- **Spend**: Actual spend for each campaign in RM.
- **Impressions**: Number of times the ad was displayed.
- **Clicks**: Number of clicks the ad received.
- **CTR**: Click-through rate.
- **Conversions**: Number of successful actions (e.g., purchases or registrations).
- **CR**: Conversion rate.
- **Revenue**: Revenue generated by the campaign in RM.
- **ROI**: Return on investment (Revenue divided by Spend).
- **Duration**: Campaign duration in days.
- **Start_Date** and **End_Date**: Start and end dates of the campaign.
- **Customer_Satisfaction**: Customer satisfaction rating (1-5).
- **Campaign_Effectiveness**: Effectiveness score according to the marketing team (1-10).
- **Market_Segment**: Targeted market segment (Low, Medium, High).

The dataset includes missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, simulating real-world data challenges.

## Methodology

The analysis process was structured as follows:

1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**:
   - Managed missing values through imputation and removal.
   - Identified and handled outliers to maintain data quality.
   - Corrected inconsistencies in categorical data (e.g., case sensitivity).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Univariate Analysis**: Examined distributions of numerical and categorical variables.
   - **Bivariate Analysis**: Explored relationships between key variables, such as budget and ROI.
   - **Multivariate Analysis**: Analyzed interdependencies among variables to uncover deeper insights, such as cluster patterns by channel and region.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualized insights through various types of plots (boxplots, heatmaps, line plots).
   - Interactive visualizations were created for time-series analysis of monthly ROI by channel.

## Key Insights

1. **Channel-Specific Insights**:
   - **Social Media and Email**: Showed consistent returns and predictable ROI, making them effective channels for targeted campaigns.
   - **Billboards**: Exhibited a wider range of ROI, indicating both high potential and high variability. Billboard campaigns should be strategically targeted for high-visibility campaigns in high-traffic areas.

2. **Regional Performance**:
   - **Kuala Lumpur**: High campaign frequency across channels, benefiting from a multi-channel approach due to the cityâ€™s urban and diverse audience.
   - **Sarawak and Sabah**: Strong performance for social media and billboards, possibly due to cultural resonance in these regions. Digital engagement is high, suggesting further investment in digital channels.

3. **Budget and Spend Analysis**:
   - Higher budgets do not necessarily yield higher ROI across all channels. Optimal budget allocation varies by channel, with digital channels showing better returns on lower budgets.
   - Experimenting with budget distribution based on channel performance data can optimize ROI without overspending.

4. **Seasonal Trends**:
   - **High ROI Months**: May and November, likely driven by Hari Raya and end-of-year spending trends.
   - **Lower ROI Periods**: September, suggesting that campaigns during this month should be low-cost and engagement-focused.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following strategies are recommended to enhance future campaign performance:

1. **Prioritize Digital Channels**: Channels like social media and email showed stable and predictable ROI. Use these channels for targeted, cost-efficient campaigns, particularly in urban areas.
   
2. **Strategic Use of Billboards**: Billboards work best in high-visibility locations or during culturally relevant periods, such as Hari Raya. Limit billboard spending unless there's a clear, targeted objective.

3. **Regional Customization**: In regions like Sarawak and Sabah, social media is a valuable channel for engaging rural audiences. Consider tailoring campaigns to reflect local values and cultural events.

4. **Seasonal Campaign Planning**: Leverage high-ROI months (May and November) for major campaigns. During lower engagement months, such as September, run smaller, engagement-focused campaigns.
